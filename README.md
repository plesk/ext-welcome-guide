# Plesk Welcome Guide

This is the public repo for the new Plesk Welcome Guide.

## Setup instructions

To be able to build your own package, you must have installed in your development environment:

* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

### Run Composer

Run Composer to build the required autoload files

```
> composer install --no-dev
```

Use the _update_ command to get the latest version of the dependencies.

### Build the React Bundle

Add required packages by running the command:

```
> yarn install
```

The configuration files are already pre-configured, thus you just need to run the following command to create the proper JavaScript file with the the React UI library included:

```
> yarn build
```

This command will update the file _main.js_ in _src/htdocs/js/_.

### Bundle the extension

Before bundling the extension you need to build the bundle file (see section above). If the JavaScript file was created properly, you may create the ready-to-install package with the command:

```
> cd src/ && zip -6r ext-welcome-guide.zip * && cd ..
```

## Placeholders in JSON configuration

It is possible to make JSON configuration more flexible by using placeholders in JSON strings. The syntax is **%%placeholder%%**.

### Static placeholders

Currently there is only one static placeholder **%%username%%**, which resolves to the current Plesk user name.

```
Hallo, %%username%%!" -> "Hallo, Max Mustermann!
```
